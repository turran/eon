There are cases where an element needs a preferred size. One case is the label, where the preferred size is the full-text size, the min size can be the ellipsized text, etc, this way a layout wont try to always use the min size. Another case is an iamge, this way, the preferred size of an image is the original size, given that it can be scaled down and up, the min/max can be adpated, etc
Add a scaler element, the scaler should be an element that can scale renderers or other elements by using a WIP property on enesim called scale which should scale the geometry not the final rendering process, ie. before applying the transformation matrix
Change the static const attributes on the different basic theme implementation into properties
