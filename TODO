The boundings of an element are always the origin_x, origin_y, actualwidth/height
A theme element *must* have width and height property that describe the real width and height of the object
Add a scaler element, the scaler should be an element that can scale renderers or other elements by using a WIP property on enesim called scale which should scale the geometry not the final rendering process, ie. before applying the transformation matrix
