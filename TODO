Now that we are building more widgets we need a way to actually set themes based on its class/child-parent relation, maybe we can create something similar to css?
Add a scaler element, the scaler should be an element that can scale renderers or other elements by using a WIP property on enesim called scale which should scale the geometry not the final rendering process, ie. before applying the transformation matrix
Change the static const attributes on the different basic theme implementation into properties
Remove every width/height/x/y/ callback on the descriptors, use the size/position where possible
List of widgets we should have:
button (DONE)
radio (DONE)
checkbox (DONE)
frame (DONE)
image (DONE)
progressbar (DONE)
spinner
slider
notebook
treeview
table
