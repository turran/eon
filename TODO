Move the theme code into the widget, the widget must be themable an element no, this way we can create eon elements as wrappers of enesim renderers easily and for cases that we do need some theme
then use a widget implementation. Layouts should inherit from widgets now too
Add a scaler element, the scaler should be an element that can scale renderers or other elements by using a WIP property on enesim called scale which should scale the geometry not the final rendering process, ie. before applying the transformation matrix
Change the static const attributes on the different basic theme implementation into properties
